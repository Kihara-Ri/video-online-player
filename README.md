# Video play service

This is a project for practice and also a useful web service for guys who need a light-weight online player service like Jellyfin, but no so many functions. I implemented it in GO.

Now I have completed the basic function of playing videos on web, using the default video player of vanilla html, and this time I have found there are lots of things that I know nothing about.

Below are some functions and new characteritics will be added:

- [ ] Get a snapshot of each video as the cover.
- [ ] Enable to edit the files, including changing the file name, deleting files.
- [ ] Support the format mkv and subtitles.
- [ ] Add a login interface.
- [ ] Design a personal video palying interface.
- [ ] Using FFmepg and try to implement multithreading.
